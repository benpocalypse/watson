[![Get it on AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/badge.svg)](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.{GITHUB.ORG}.{GITHUB.APP}])

## System requirements

  - [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io) 6 (Odin)

## Developer notes

### Getting started

Clone this repository and run the install task:

```shell
task/install
```

You can now run the app from either the _Applications Menu_ or using the run task:

```shell
task/run
```

### About

This project is written in [Vala](https://valadoc.org/) and follows the following elementary OS guidelines:

  - [Human Interface Guidelines](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/)
  - [Developer Guidelines](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/)
  - [Coding style](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/code-style)

Please take some time to familiarise yourself with those documents before continuing.

To get your system ready to develop for elementary OS, please see the [Basic Setup](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/the-basic-setup) section of the [elementary OS Developer Documentation](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/).

### Tasks

```shell
task/install
```

#### Build

```shell
task/build
```

#### Run

#### Run Package

Creates and runs a Flatpak package.

```shell
task/run-package

### VSCodium

You do _not_ need to use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) to create elementary OS apps.

You can, for instance, use elementary OS [Code](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/the-basic-setup#code), which comes preinstalled, or a different third-party editor like [Builder](https://apps.gnome.org/en/app/org.gnome.Builder/).

However, if you do have VSCodium installed, there are a number of extensions that will make creating your elementary OS app easier:

  - [Vala](https://github.com/Prince781/vala-vscode) (`codium --install-extension prince781.vala`)
  - [Meson](https://github.com/asabil/vscode-meson) (`codium --install-extension asabil.meson`)
  - [CodeLLDB](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb) (`codium --install-extension vadimcn.vscode-lldb`)
  - [XML](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-xml) (`codium --install-extension redhat.vscode-xml`)
  - [YAML](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-yaml) (`codium --install-extension redhat.vscode-yaml`)

If you have the Meson and CodeLLDB extensions installed, you can run and debug the app using the Run and Debug feature (or just hit <kbd>F5</kbd>.)

## Continuous integration

[Continuous Integration](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/writing-apps/our-first-app/continuous-integration) is set up for this repository.

## Submitting the app

Please make sure you [review the AppCenter publishing requirements](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/appcenter/publishing-requirements) <strike>before [submitting the app](https://developer.elementary.io/) to the [elementary OS AppCenter](https://appcenter.elementary.io/).</strike>* before opening a pull request on the [AppCenter Reviews repository](https://github.com/elementary/appcenter-reviews).

_\* The elementary OS AppCenter dashboard is currently broken. The version currently linked to from the elementary OS Developer site is for elementary OS 5, not 6. However, if you want to monetise your app, you still have to use that and then submit the pull request. If you know [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), you might want to [contribute to finishing off the AppCenter dashboard for elementary OS 6](https://github.com/elementary/appcenter-reviews)._

## It’s elementary, my dear…

This project was initially generated by [Watson](https://github.com/small-tech/watson), a tool for quickly setting up a new elementary OS 6 app that follows platform [human interface](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/) and [development](https://docs.elementary.io/develop/) guidelines.
